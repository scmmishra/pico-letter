date: 24 Oct, 2020

A new way to discover JavaScript packages and two major releases, here are the top stories of this week.

## Launch: [Skypack Discover](https://www.skypack.dev/blog/2020/10/introducing-skypack-discover/)

Skypack discover is here to solve the discovery problem of JavaScript packages, a better alternative to jumping between npmjs, bundlephobia, Stack Overflow and more.

> It’s like Wirecutter or Spotify playlists, but for open source JavaScript.

## Release: [Node 15](https://nodejs.medium.com/node-js-v15-0-0-is-here-deb00750f278)

Node 15 features npm 7, experimental QUIC support. This version is based on v8 8.6 adding the following new features:

- `Promise.any()`
- `AggregateError`
- `String.prototype.replaceAll()`
- Logical assignment operators `&&=`, `||=`, and `??=`

## Release: [React 17](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html)

> The React 17 release is unusual because it doesn’t add any new developer-facing features. Instead, this release is primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself.

This release focuses a lot on developer experience, enabling gradual upgrades. This version makes it safer to embed a tree managed by one version of React inside a tree managed by a different version of React.
