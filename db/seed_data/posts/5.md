An exciting week with major announcements and releases, here are the top 3 stories from this week.

## Announcement: [Moment.js Project Status](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status)

> We now generally consider Moment to be a legacy project in maintenance mode. It is not dead, but it is indeed done.

While you could say Moment.js threw in the towel, what has happened is that the project completed its life, which is a rare sight to see, especially in the front-end world!

## Release: [Vue 3 - One Piece](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

This new major version of the framework provides improved performance, smaller bundle sizes, better TypeScript integration, new APIs for tackling large scale use cases, and a solid foundation for long-term future iterations of the framework.

## Release: [Deno 1.4](https://deno.land/posts/v1.4)

Big new release from deno land, here are some highlights:

- **Web Standard WebSocket API**
- **Automatic restarts on file change**
- **Integrated test coverage**
